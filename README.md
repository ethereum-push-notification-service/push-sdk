# PUSH-SDK

PUSH SDK is a Javascript based Monorepo of packages that helps developers to 
- build PUSH features into their DApps
- get access to PUSH Push Nodes APIs
- render PUSH Notifications UI

without having to write a lot of boilerplate code. All the heavy lifting is done by the SDK, so that you the developer can focus on building features and bootstrap a DApp with PUSH features in no time!

The SDK provides a suite of solutions for different problems. It is written in Typescript and supports React, React Native, Plain JS, Node JS based platforms. (We are adding support for more!)

*It is also built on top of standard Web3 packages like `ethers`, `@web3-react`*

## Sample Usage
*How to use a package from the SDK?*

Let's take `@pushprotocol/restapi` as an example.

Open a teminal and enter
```bash
mkdir sdk-quickstart
cd sdk-quickstart

# at sdk-quickstart, hit enter for all if no change from default intended
yarn init 

# or NPM
npm init
```

If you want to use ES6 Modules syntax then inside `package.json` set “type” to “module”.

```bash
# install the sdk "restapi" package & its peer dependencies in your app
yarn add @pushprotocol/restapi ethers

# or NPM
npm install @pushprotocol/restapi ethers
```

```bash
touch main.js
```

For *CommonJS* Syntax
```typescript
// import in main.js
const PushAPI = require("@pushprotocol/restapi");
```

**OR**

For *ES6 modules* Syntax
```typescript
// import in main.js
import * as PushAPI from "@pushprotocol/restapi";
```

```typescript
// use a feature from restapi package,
// here "getFeeds" gets all the notifications for the user address provided
const main = async() => {
  const notifications = await PushAPI.getNotifications({
    user: 'eip155:5:0xD8634C39BBFd4033c0d3289C4515275102423681', // user address in CAIP
    env: 'staging'
  });

  // log the notifications 
  console.log('notifications: \n\n', notifications);
}

main();
```

Then to run this code open terminal and type

```bash
node main
```
