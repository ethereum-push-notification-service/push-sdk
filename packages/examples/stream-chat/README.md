# About Automated Chat
Automated chat example shows how you can receive chats when you talk to someone using Push Chat. In this example, we establish a socket connection and then send a message to pushai.eth, which is an automated chat bot that replies back.

## What's the use case
You can use this example to see the functionality of sockets and how you can respond to messages from backend (server) when a wallet messages you (or a wallet you own). Some use cases are:

- Creating an automated support bot
- Creating an AI chat bot
