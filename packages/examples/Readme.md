# Welcome to Push SDK Examples!

This repository houses various practical examples that illustrate how to use the Push SDK effectively to enhance your applications with advanced web3 communication functionalities.

## One-Stop Solution for Understanding the Implementation of Push Protocol's SDK

The `push-sdk` repository provides two comprehensive examples that serve as practical guides for developers:

1. `sdk-backend-node`: A backend implementation using Node.js.
2. `sdk-frontend-react`: A frontend implementation of notifications and chat using react.
3. `sdk-frontend/video`: A frontend implementation focusing on video notifications.

These examples illuminate the application of the Push Protocol in real-world scenarios, making it easier for you to effectively incorporate it into your own projects.

They are the perfect starting point for any hacker looking to dive into the world of decentralized notifications. Explore, learn, and create with the Push Protocol. Happy hacking!
