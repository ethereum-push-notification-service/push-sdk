## Repo Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/sdk.git

cd sdk
```

```
yarn install
```

**_Note_** -
We are using `yarn` and **strongly** advise to use yarn 1.x to avoid any NPM issues.

## Pull Requests process

- All changes should be requested through PRs from a feature/bug branch to `main` branch.
- We are using
  - [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary): to follow [semver](https://semver.org/#summary) for npm package versioning
  - [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to restrict commits to follow conventional commits
  - [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to run pre-commit checks

So, use `yarn cz` to commit changes after `git add` (recommended) or hand crafted git commit messages to follow conventional commit. Otherwise the CLI will prevent you from committing code.

- Before starting on any dev on the repo,

```bash
# pull latest from main
git pull origin main
git fetch --tags

# checkout new branch
git checkout -b <your-branch-name>
```

### How to add commits which will decide versioning when deploying

When you are ready to commit your changes.

Run

```
git add -A
```

then

```
yarn cz
```

this will pop up the below CLI

Read through the [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) and [semver](https://semver.org/#summary) to get a better understanding for selecting which option.

### General guideline

- for bug fixes use `fix`
- for backward compatible new features use `feat`

## NX

We are using [NX](https://nx.dev/getting-started/intro) and some NX plugins for monorepo management, verison & publish.

### NX console

The repo comes in with a baked in NX console and some other VSCode extensions to -

- help simplify processes like build, lint, test, run demo apps
- run scripts on affected parts of the codebase

**_Note_** -
<span style="color:red">Don't run CI-prefixed targets in the NX console in local, they are only for CI.</span>.

## Adding new packages

The NX monorepo uses `project.json` & `package.json` to manage the monorepo workspace and also ultimately build out the bundle that will be published to NPM registry.

### - adding `dependencies` to a package

at root, simply run

```
yarn add "dependency_package_name@x.y.z"
```

And then simply import that dependency in your package. NX while running `build` for that package will take care of making it a `dependency` in the final bundle.

### - adding `devDependencies` to a package

at root, simply run

```
yarn add -D "dependency_package_name@x.y.z"
```

And then simply import that dependency in your package. NX while running `build` for that package will take care of making it a `devDependency` in the final bundle.

### - adding `peerDependencies` to a package

at root, simply run

```
yarn add "dependency_package_name@x.y.z"
```

And then simply import that dependency in your package. In the `package.json` of the package where you want to consume it, simply declare the dependency as `peerDependency`
NX while running `build` for that package will take care of making it a `peerDependency` in the final bundle.
